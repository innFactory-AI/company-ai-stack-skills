# Capacity Planning Skill

Assess workforce and resource capacity against forecasted demand — with utilisation analysis, gap identification, and scenario modelling. The underlying numbers come from you, a connected source, or uploaded files.

## Where the Data Comes From

| Source | What It Adds |
| --- | --- |
| **Project / resource tools via MCP** (e.g. Jira, Asana, Monday) | Current allocations, project schedules, milestones, open work |
| **HRIS via MCP** (e.g. Personio, Workday) | Headcount, FTE equivalents, leave, skill profiles |
| **companyRAG collections** | Historical utilisation data, past capacity plans, planning guidelines |
| **File upload (CSV/XLSX)** | Utilisation sheets, demand pipelines, headcount lists |

> **No connected source?** Provide the data in chat or upload the relevant files — the skill works the same way.

## Capacity Assessment Framework

### Supply Inventory

Before forecasting demand, establish what capacity currently exists. For each team or resource pool:

1. Headcount: Number of people, FTE equivalents (account for part-time, contractors, shared resources)
2. Available hours: Total working hours minus planned leave, public holidays, training days, admin overhead
3. Skill profile: Capabilities per person or role — what types of work each resource can perform
4. Current allocation: Existing commitments by project, BAU (business-as-usual), and support obligations
5. Utilisation rate: (Allocated hours ÷ Available hours) × 100 — calculated from the organisation's own data

### Utilisation Classification

| Band | Utilisation | Interpretation | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Under-utilised** | Below target band | Capacity available for new work or reallocation | Identify suitable work; check for skill mismatches |
| **Target band** | Organisation-defined optimal range | Healthy operating state with buffer for unplanned work | Maintain; monitor for drift |
| **Over-utilised** | Above target band | Sustained overload risk — quality, morale, and attrition exposure | Redistribute, defer, or augment |

The target band is organisation-specific. Do not assume a default. Ask the user to define their target utilisation range. If undefined, prompt them to set one based on their historical data and tolerance for unplanned work absorption.

### Capacity Calculation

For each team or resource pool:

```
CAPACITY SUMMARY:
  Team/Pool:              [name]
  Headcount (FTE):        [from org data]
  Available hours/period: [total working hours - leave - overhead]
  Currently allocated:    [hours committed to existing work]
  Remaining capacity:     [available - allocated]
  Utilisation rate:       [allocated ÷ available × 100]%
  Utilisation band:       [Under / Target / Over]
```

Aggregate across teams to produce an organisational capacity view. Flag teams where utilisation bands differ significantly — one team under-utilised while another is over-utilised signals a rebalancing opportunity.

## Demand Forecasting

### Demand Source Identification

Catalogue all sources of demand on the resource pool:

| Source Type | Examples | Predictability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Committed projects** | Approved roadmap items, signed contracts, regulatory deadlines | High — known scope and timeline |
| **Pipeline projects** | Proposals in progress, budget requests pending approval | Medium — adjust by probability of approval |
| **BAU / run-the-business** | Support, maintenance, operational tasks, recurring reporting | High — use historical average with seasonal adjustment |
| **Unplanned / reactive** | Incidents, ad-hoc requests, executive priorities | Low — reserve capacity based on historical frequency |
| **Strategic initiatives** | Transformation programmes, new market entry, M&A integration | Variable — scenario-dependent |

### Demand Quantification

For each demand source:

1. Estimate effort: Hours or FTEs required per period. Use three-point estimation (optimistic, likely, pessimistic) for uncertain items.
2. Weight by probability: For pipeline items, multiply effort by probability of materialising. Committed = 100%, pipeline = organisation's historical conversion rate.
3. Map timing: When does the demand hit? Spread across periods based on project schedules.
4. Identify skill requirements: What capabilities does each demand source require? Match against the supply skill profile.

### Three-Point Estimation

For uncertain demand items, use:

```
Expected effort = (Optimistic + 4 × Likely + Pessimistic) ÷ 6
Standard deviation = (Pessimistic - Optimistic) ÷ 6
```

This produces a weighted average that accounts for estimation uncertainty. The standard deviation indicates confidence — large spreads between optimistic and pessimistic signal high uncertainty that should be addressed through scenario modelling rather than single-point planning. Work these calculations from the provided numbers and show your reasoning so the result stays verifiable.

## Gap Analysis

### Supply-Demand Comparison

For each period and skill category:

```
GAP ANALYSIS:
  Period:             [time window]
  Skill category:     [role type or capability]
  Supply (FTE):       [available capacity from supply inventory]
  Demand (FTE):       [forecasted demand, probability-weighted]
  Gap:                [supply - demand; positive = surplus, negative = shortfall]
  Confidence:         [High / Medium / Low based on estimation spread]
  Gap classification: [Surplus / Balanced / Moderate shortfall / Critical shortfall]
```

### Gap Classification

| Classification | Condition | Risk Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Surplus** | Supply exceeds demand by more than the unplanned buffer | Low — but monitor for cost efficiency |
| **Balanced** | Supply meets demand within the unplanned buffer | Low — healthy operating state |
| **Moderate shortfall** | Demand exceeds supply by up to the organisation's defined threshold | Medium — addressable through prioritisation or temporary augmentation |
| **Critical shortfall** | Demand exceeds supply beyond the threshold | High — requires immediate action: scope reduction, timeline extension, or resource acquisition |

The threshold between moderate and critical is organisation-specific. Prompt the user to define it if not established.

## Scenario Modelling

Build at minimum three scenarios to stress-test the capacity plan:

### Scenario Structure

| Scenario | Demand Assumption | Supply Assumption | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Base case** | Committed + probability-weighted pipeline | Current headcount + approved hires | Most likely outcome |
| **High demand** | Committed + all pipeline at 100% + unplanned demand uplift | Current headcount + approved hires | Stress test for demand surge |
| **Constrained supply** | Base case demand | Current headcount minus attrition estimate, no new hires | Impact of hiring freeze or attrition spike |

For each scenario, run the gap analysis and document:

- Which teams or skill categories hit critical shortfall first
- At what point in the timeline the gap becomes unmanageable
- What levers are available (see Recommendation Framework below)

Add organisation-specific scenarios as needed (e.g., M&A integration, market expansion, technology migration).

## Recommendation Framework

When gaps are identified, evaluate mitigation options in this priority order:

| Priority | Lever | Lead Time | Cost Impact | Reversibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Reprioritise demand** | Immediate | None | High |
| 2 | **Redistribute across teams** | Days–weeks | Low | High |
| 3 | **Improve efficiency** | Weeks–months | Low–Medium | High |
| 4 | **Temporary augmentation** (contractors, vendors) | Weeks | Medium–High | High |
| 5 | **Permanent hire** | Months | High | Low |
| 6 | **Defer or descope work** | Immediate | Variable | Medium |

For each recommendation:

```
RECOMMENDATION:
  Gap addressed:     [which shortfall this mitigates]
  Lever:             [from priority table]
  Specific action:   [concrete step — not "hire more people" but "hire 2 senior backend engineers by Q3"]
  Effort to implement: [time and resources required to execute the lever]
  Expected impact:   [FTE equivalent or hours recovered]
  Timeline:          [when the capacity becomes available]
  Risk:              [what could prevent this from working]
  Dependencies:      [approvals, budget, market availability]
```

## Output Template

## Adapt to Your Business

Adapt this skill to your organisation by defining:

- Target utilisation band: Your optimal range (e.g., 75-85%) and the rationale behind it
- Planning horizon: How far ahead you plan (quarterly, semi-annually, annually)
- Demand probability thresholds: Your conversion rates for pipeline to committed work
- Critical shortfall threshold: The gap size that triggers escalation
- Unplanned work buffer: Percentage of capacity reserved for reactive work (based on historical data)
- Attrition assumptions: Expected turnover rate for supply modelling
- Approval workflows: Who authorises each mitigation lever

## Guardrails

- Never generate headcount benchmarks, staffing ratios, or utilisation targets from training data. All numbers must come from the user's organisational data.
- Never assume a "standard" utilisation target. Ask the user to define their target band.
- Never fabricate pipeline data or demand forecasts. All demand inputs come from the user. When data is insufficient, state "insufficient data to forecast" rather than extrapolating.
- Label generated content: `[From org data]`, `[Framework methodology]`, `[AI estimate — verify]`.
