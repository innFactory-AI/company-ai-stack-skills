# Research Synthesis Skill

Transform raw qualitative and quantitative research data into actionable product insights. The skill covers thematic analysis, evidence strength assessment, insight-to-opportunity mapping, and readout structuring. All research data must come from you, a connected source, or companyRAG collections.

## Where the Data Comes From

| Source | What it contributes |
| --- | --- |
| **MCP servers** (e.g. Notion, Confluence, Jira, a connected research repository) | Research databases, study pages, tickets carrying user feedback |
| **companyRAG collections** | Interview notes, transcripts, survey exports, usability-test protocols |
| **File upload** | Individual transcripts, survey CSV exports, readout drafts |

> **No connected source?** Provide the data in chat or upload the relevant files — the skill works the same way.

## Research Synthesis Workflow

Execute these five phases sequentially. Rushing to recommendations (Phase 5) without proper coding (Phase 2) and theming (Phase 3) produces unreliable insights.

### Phase 1: Inventory & Classify Source Data

Before analysis, catalogue what data is available and assess its characteristics.

```
RESEARCH INVENTORY
  Project:          [research project name]
  Research question: [the question this research was designed to answer]

  Data sources:
  | Source Type | Count | Method | Participants | Date Range |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | [e.g., user interviews] | [count] | [1:1 / group / unmoderated] | [segment description] | [dates] |
  | [e.g., survey responses] | [count] | [open-ended / structured / mixed] | [segment description] | [dates] |

  Participant coverage:
  | Segment | Target | Actual | Gap |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | [segment] | [target n] | [actual n] | [over/under/met] |

  Known limitations:
  - [e.g., only interviewed power users — new user perspective missing]
  - [e.g., survey had 15% response rate — self-selection bias likely]
```

**Data sufficiency check**: Before proceeding, assess whether the data can credibly answer the research question. If significant participant segments are missing or sample sizes are very small, flag this limitation prominently — it constrains every finding that follows.

### Phase 2: Code the Data

Coding transforms raw data into structured, analysable units. This is the most labour-intensive phase and the one most tempted to skip.

**Coding process**:

1. Extract observations : Go through each data source and pull out discrete observations — specific things participants said, did, or experienced. One observation per unit.

```
OBSERVATION:
  Participant: [ID — anonymised]
  Source:      [interview / survey / usability test / support ticket]
  Verbatim:   [exact quote or description of observed behaviour]
  Context:     [what prompted this — question asked, task attempted, scenario]
```

1. Assign codes : Label each observation with a descriptive code. Codes are short labels that capture the concept.

**Coding discipline**:

- Use participant language where possible — resist imposing your own framework prematurely
- One observation can have multiple codes (behaviour often relates to multiple themes)
- Start with open coding (bottom-up from data) before applying any predefined categories
- When the same concept appears with different wording across participants, use a consistent code
- Track code frequency but do NOT equate frequency with importance — a rare but severe pain point may matter more than a common mild one

1. Build the codebook : As codes accumulate, organise them:

```
CODEBOOK
| Code | Definition | Example Observation | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| [code name] | [what this code means] | [representative quote] | [n participants] |
```

### Phase 3: Thematic Analysis

Themes are patterns that emerge from grouping related codes. A theme is NOT a summary of individual observations — it is an interpretive claim about what the observations collectively mean.

**Theme construction process**:

1. **Cluster codes**: Group related codes that point to the same underlying pattern. Look for:   - Codes that frequently co-occur (same participants exhibit both)   - Codes that describe different facets of the same experience   - Codes that form a causal chain (one leads to another)
2. **Name the theme**: A good theme name is an interpretive statement, not a topic label.   - Topic label (weak): "Onboarding"   - Interpretive theme (strong): "Users abandon onboarding when they cannot connect it to their immediate task"
3. **Assess theme strength**:

| Evidence Level | Criteria | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Strong** | Theme supported by 5+ participants across multiple segments; consistent pattern with specific, detailed evidence | High — reliable basis for product decisions |
| **Moderate** | Theme supported by 3-4 participants or concentrated in one segment; pattern is clear but coverage is limited | Medium — worth acting on with awareness of limitations |
| **Emerging** | Theme supported by 1-2 participants; the observation is striking but not yet a pattern | Low — hypothesis for further research, not a basis for decisions |

1. Document each theme :

```
THEME: [Interpretive statement]
  Strength:     [Strong / Moderate / Emerging]
  Codes included: [list of codes that form this theme]
  Supporting evidence:
    - P[id]: "[verbatim quote]" — [context]
    - P[id]: "[verbatim quote]" — [context]
    - P[id]: "[observed behaviour]" — [context]
  Counter-evidence: [any observations that contradict this theme]
  Segments affected: [which participant segments exhibit this pattern]
  Relationship to other themes: [does this theme interact with others?]
```

**Rigour checks**:

- Every theme must have direct evidence (quotes or observed behaviours) — not inferences
- Actively seek counter-evidence — observations that contradict the theme. A theme with no counter-evidence may not have been examined critically enough.
- If two themes overlap heavily, merge them or sharpen the distinction

### Phase 4: Insight-to-Opportunity Mapping

Translate themes into product opportunities. An insight describes what is happening and why; an opportunity describes what could be done about it.

**Mapping framework**:

```
INSIGHT → OPPORTUNITY

Insight:      [What is happening and why — derived from a theme]
Evidence:     [Theme strength: Strong / Moderate / Emerging]
User impact:  [How this affects the user — severity × frequency]
Opportunity:  [What could the product team do about it?]
Opportunity type:
  - Pain relief:      Remove or reduce a source of friction
  - Unmet need:       Deliver capability users lack today
  - Delight:          Exceed expectations in a way users did not anticipate
  - Efficiency gain:  Make an existing workflow meaningfully faster
Confidence:   [How confident are we this opportunity is real? Based on evidence strength + user impact assessment]
```

**Prioritisation of opportunities** (not a replacement for RICE — a research-informed input to it):

| Factor | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| **Evidence strength** | Strong themes produce higher-confidence opportunities |
| **User impact** | Severity (how painful?) × Breadth (how many users affected?) |
| **Strategic alignment** | Does this opportunity connect to current OKRs or product strategy? |
| **Feasibility signal** | Did users suggest or describe workarounds that hint at solution approaches? |

Order opportunities by: Strong evidence + high impact first, then moderate evidence + high impact, then strong evidence + moderate impact. Emerging-evidence opportunities go to "further research needed," not to the product backlog.

### Phase 5: Research Readout

Structure the synthesis for team consumption. Different audiences need different formats.

#### Full Research Readout

For the product team, design team, and research stakeholders:

```
# Research Synthesis — [Project Name]
Date: [date]    |    Researcher: [name]

## 1. Research Question & Method
[What we set out to learn, how we investigated, who participated]

## 2. Participant Overview
[Segments represented, sample sizes, known gaps]

## 3. Key Themes
[Ordered by evidence strength — strongest first]
  Theme 1: [interpretive statement] — [Strong/Moderate/Emerging]
    [Supporting evidence summary with representative quotes]
  Theme 2: ...

## 4. Opportunities
[Mapped from themes, ordered by confidence × impact]
  Opportunity 1: [description] — Evidence: [strength] — Impact: [assessment]
  Opportunity 2: ...

## 5. Recommendations
[Specific product actions, with evidence basis and confidence level for each]

## 6. Limitations & Caveats
[What this research cannot tell us — sample gaps, methodological constraints]

## 7. Further Research Needed
[Questions raised but not answered — with suggested methods]
```

#### Executive Summary

For stakeholders who need the headline, not the methodology:

```
RESEARCH SUMMARY — [Project Name] — [Date]

Key finding:    [One-sentence headline — the single most important insight]
Evidence base:  [n participants, methods used, segments covered]

Top 3 insights:
1. [Insight] — [Supporting data point] — Confidence: [H/M/L]
2. [Insight] — [Supporting data point] — Confidence: [H/M/L]
3. [Insight] — [Supporting data point] — Confidence: [H/M/L]

Recommended actions:
1. [Action] — Owner: [name] — Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
2. [Action] — Owner: [name] — Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

Limitations: [Key caveats in one sentence]
```

## Combining Qualitative and Quantitative Data

When both types of data are available (e.g., interview themes + survey percentages + analytics data):

1. Quantitative first for "what" : Use metrics and survey data to identify WHAT is happening — which features are underused, where users drop off, what satisfaction scores look like
2. Qualitative for "why" : Use interview and observational data to explain WHY the quantitative patterns exist
3. Triangulation : When qual and quant point the same direction, confidence increases. When they diverge, investigate — the divergence itself is an insight.
4. Never use qual to "validate" quant (or vice versa) — they answer different questions. Qual explains motivations and context; quant measures scale and frequency.

## Guardrails

- NEVER fabricate participant quotes, observations, or research data. Every observation, code, and theme must trace to user-provided source material.
- NEVER claim research findings are "statistically significant" without quantitative analysis. Qualitative research produces thematic patterns with evidence strength levels, not statistical significance.
- Counter-evidence is mandatory. When presenting a theme, actively note contradicting observations. Omitting counter-evidence is a form of fabrication.
- Source-label every element as `[From research data]`, `[Synthesis framework]`, or `[AI interpretation — verify with researcher]`.
