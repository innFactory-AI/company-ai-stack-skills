# Learning Plan Skill

Assess skill gaps, map development activities to a career framework, and design individual or team learning plans with measurable milestones. Role requirements, competency definitions, and employee data come from you, a connected MCP source, or companyRAG collections.

## Where the Data Comes From

| Source | What It Adds |
| --- | --- |
| **LMS via MCP** (e.g. Moodle, Cornerstone, SAP SuccessFactors) | Learning catalogue, completed courses, certifications, available learning paths |
| **HRIS via MCP** (e.g. Workday, Personio, BambooHR) | Roles and levels, team roster, performance data, career framework |
| **companyRAG / file upload** | Competency frameworks, job architecture, self- and manager assessments, 360 feedback |

> **No connected source?** Provide the data in chat or upload the relevant files — the skill works the same way.

## Regulatory Awareness

Employee development activities may involve processing personal data (skill assessments, performance-linked development plans, learning records). Reference the handle-gdpr skill for data processing requirements when development plans are stored in systems or shared beyond the direct manager-employee relationship.

Works council or employee representative consultation may be required when establishing or modifying systematic training programmes in some jurisdictions. Verify with employment counsel in the applicable jurisdiction.

## Learning Plan Workflow

Follow these steps in order. The workflow scales from a single individual development plan to a team-wide training programme.

### Step 1: Assess Current Skills

Establish a baseline of current capabilities before identifying gaps.

**For an individual:**

| Input | Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current role and job level | Job architecture / user input | Sets the baseline expectation |
| Target role or next level | Career framework / user input | Sets the aspiration |
| Self-assessment | Employee input | Employee's own view of strengths and gaps |
| Manager assessment | Manager input | Manager's view of demonstrated capabilities |
| Performance data | Review outcomes / user input | Evidence of demonstrated strengths and development areas |
| Feedback (peers, stakeholders) | 360 data / user input | Broader perspective on capabilities |

**For a team:**

| Input | Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Team roster with roles and levels | HRIS / user input | Scope of the assessment |
| Team capability requirements | Business strategy / user input | What the team needs to deliver |
| Individual assessments (aggregated) | Per-individual process above | Aggregate skill landscape |
| Business priorities for the period | Leadership / user input | Directional filter for development investment |

Produce a skill inventory using the competency framework relevant to the role or team. If no formal framework exists, co-create a role-relevant skill list with the user and label it: [Co-created — validate against your career framework].

### Step 2: Identify Gaps

Compare current capabilities against requirements for the current role (performance gaps) and the target role (development gaps).

```
SKILL GAP ANALYSIS:
  Employee / Team: [name or team]
  Current role:    [title and level]
  Target role:     [title and level, if different]

  SKILL: [name]
    Current level:  [from assessment — e.g., Developing / Competent / Advanced / Expert]
    Required level: [from framework — for current role]
    Target level:   [from framework — for target role]
    Gap:            [none / minor / significant / critical]
    Priority:       [high / medium / low — based on business impact and career aspiration]

  SKILL: [next skill]
    ...
```

**Gap prioritisation criteria:**

| Factor | High Priority | Medium Priority | Low Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Business impact | Skill gap blocks current deliverables or team goals | Skill would improve quality or efficiency | Nice-to-have for future capability |
| Career progression | Required for next-level promotion readiness | Expected within 12 months | Aspirational or exploratory |
| Urgency | Needed in next quarter | Needed within 6 months | 6–12 month development horizon |
| Availability of learning | Learning opportunities are available now | Opportunities exist but require planning | Requires creating new learning pathways |

### Step 3: Map to Development Activities

For each prioritised gap, identify appropriate development activities. Use the 70-20-10 framework as a DESIGN LENS, not a rigid allocation rule — the actual mix depends on the skill type and the learner's context.

| Learning Type | Examples | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **On-the-job (experiential)** | Stretch assignments, project rotations, shadowing, deputising, leading a workstream | Building practical capability, applying new knowledge, developing judgment |
| **Social (relationship-based)** | Mentoring, coaching, peer learning groups, cross-functional collaboration, community of practice | Tacit knowledge transfer, perspective broadening, network building |
| **Formal (structured)** | Courses, certifications, workshops, conferences, structured reading programmes | Foundational knowledge, technical skills, compliance requirements |

**Activity selection process:**

1. For each skill gap, identify at least one activity from each learning type that could address it
2. Assess feasibility: time commitment, cost, availability, manager support, business disruption
3. Select the activity mix that balances learning effectiveness with practical constraints
4. Ensure at least one experiential activity per gap — formal learning alone rarely closes capability gaps

### Step 4: Design the Plan

Assemble the gap analysis and activity mapping into a structured development plan.

```
# Individual Development Plan — [Name]
Date created: [date]
Review date:  [next review date — recommend quarterly]
Manager:      [name]

## Development Summary
  Current role:  [title and level]
  Target role:   [title and level, if different]
  Plan horizon:  [6 months / 12 months]
  Focus areas:   [2-4 priority skills from gap analysis]

## Development Goals

### Goal 1: [Skill / Competency Name]
  Current state: [assessment]
  Target state:  [expected level by review date]
  Priority:      [high / medium]
  Business link: [how this connects to current deliverables or team goals]

  Activities:
  - [Activity 1 — type: experiential / social / formal]
    Timeline: [start — end]
    Success indicator: [observable evidence that learning is happening]
    Support needed: [from manager, team, budget]

  - [Activity 2]
    ...

  Milestone: [Specific, observable checkpoint — what will be demonstrably different?]
  Milestone date: [date]

### Goal 2: [next skill]
  ...

## Support and Resources
  Manager commitments: [time for 1:1s, access to projects, feedback cadence]
  Budget: [if applicable — courses, conferences, certifications]
  Time allocation: [dedicated learning time, protected calendar blocks]

## Review Schedule
  - [Date]: Quarterly check-in — assess progress against milestones
  - [Date]: Mid-plan review — adjust activities if gaps are closing faster or slower than expected
  - [Date]: Plan completion review — assess outcomes, set next development cycle
```

### Step 5: Set Milestones and Success Indicators

Every development goal needs observable milestones — not just "complete the course" but evidence of capability change.

**Milestone quality criteria:**

| Criterion | Good Milestone | Weak Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Observable | "Lead a client presentation independently" | "Improve presentation skills" |
| Time-bound | "By end of Q2" | "Eventually" |
| Evidence-based | "Deliver the Q3 architecture proposal to the team" | "Understand architecture better" |
| Proportional | Achievable within the plan horizon with the planned activities | Requires a career's worth of development |

**Progress indicators by development phase:**

| Phase | Duration | Indicator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Awareness | Weeks 1–4 | Can articulate the skill and why it matters for the role |
| Application | Months 1–3 | Applies the skill with support or guidance |
| Competence | Months 3–6 | Applies the skill independently in standard situations |
| Proficiency | Months 6–12 | Applies the skill in complex or novel situations; can coach others |

## Team Training Programme Design

When designing learning plans for a team rather than an individual:

1. Aggregate the skill gap analysis across team members — identify common gaps vs. individual gaps
2. Common gaps → group learning activities (workshops, team learning sessions, shared projects)
3. Individual gaps → personalised development activities within the team programme
4. Sequence activities so foundational skills are addressed before advanced ones
5. Balance development with delivery — the team still has work to do; plan development in realistic increments

## Guardrails

- Never generate specific course names, training providers, or platform recommendations from training data. All learning resources must come from the user's L&D catalogue.
- Never assess an individual's skill level without explicit input from the employee, manager, or performance data. Do not infer capabilities from job titles or tenure.
- Never claim specific timelines for skill development. Development pace depends on the individual, the skill, and the context.
- Source-label all output: `[Framework methodology]`, `[From career framework]`, `[Co-created — validate]`, or `[AI suggestion — verify with L&D team]`.
