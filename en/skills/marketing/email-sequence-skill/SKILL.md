# Email Sequence Skill

Design multi-email automated sequences — from goal definition through sequence architecture with timing and branching logic to individual email drafts and performance benchmarks. For automated sequences only, not one-off campaigns or newsletters.

## Where the Data Comes From

| Source | What It Adds |
| --- | --- |
| **ESP / marketing automation via MCP** (e.g. HubSpot, Mailchimp) | Existing sequences, segments, historical open/click data, personalisation tokens |
| **CRM via MCP** (e.g. HubSpot, Salesforce) | Lifecycle stages, lead scores, account data, enrollment triggers |
| **companyRAG / file upload** | Brand guidelines, tone-of-voice rules, past campaign briefs, product information |

> **No connected source?** Provide the data in chat or upload the relevant files — the skill works the same way.

## Sequence Design Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Each step informs the next — rushing to drafting without defining the goal and mapping the sequence produces emails that do not work together as a system.

### Step 1: Define the Sequence Goal

Every sequence exists to move a recipient from a current state to a desired state. Define both.

```
SEQUENCE GOAL:
  Sequence name:   [descriptive name]
  Sequence type:   [onboarding / nurture / re-engagement / event-triggered / lifecycle]
  Entry trigger:   [what action or event enrolls someone in this sequence?]
  Current state:   [where is the recipient now? — e.g., signed up but not activated]
  Desired state:   [where should they be after the sequence? — e.g., completed first project]
  Primary metric:  [the ONE number that defines sequence success]
  Exit conditions: [what removes someone from the sequence — achieved goal, unsubscribed, enrolled in another sequence, time elapsed]
```

**Goal quality check:**

| Check | Question | If No |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specific | Can you describe the desired state in one sentence? | Narrow the scope |
| Measurable | Can you track whether recipients reached the desired state? | Choose a trackable metric |
| Bounded | Does the sequence have a clear end? | Define exit conditions |
| Distinct | Is this goal different from other active sequences? | Merge or differentiate |

### Step 2: Select Sequence Type and Map Architecture

Use the sequence type router to determine the appropriate architecture pattern, then map the specific sequence.

#### Sequence Type Router

| Type | Entry Trigger | Typical Length | Core Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Onboarding** | Account creation, purchase, subscription start | 5–10 emails over 14–30 days | Progressive activation milestones |
| **Nurture** | Content download, webinar registration, lead score threshold | 4–8 emails over 3–8 weeks | Value delivery building to conversion ask |
| **Re-engagement** | Inactivity for defined period (30/60/90 days) | 3–5 emails over 10–21 days | Escalating urgency with final sunset |
| **Event-triggered** | Specific user action (cart abandonment, feature use, milestone) | 2–4 emails over 3–7 days | Contextual follow-up on the trigger event |
| **Lifecycle** | Time-based milestones (anniversary, renewal date approaching) | 3–6 emails over 2–4 weeks | Relationship reinforcement and expansion |

#### Architecture Mapping

For each email in the sequence, define:

```
SEQUENCE MAP:

Email 1: [Name / Purpose]
  Timing:     [Trigger + delay — e.g., "Immediately after signup" or "Day 3"]
  Goal:       [What should the recipient DO after reading this email?]
  Content theme: [Core message — not the full draft yet]
  CTA:        [Primary call to action]
  Branch after: [If recipient takes action → skip to Email X / exit. If no action → continue to Email 2]

Email 2: [Name / Purpose]
  Timing:     [Delay from previous email or trigger]
  Condition:  [Who receives this? — e.g., "Recipients who did NOT complete onboarding step 1"]
  Goal:       [...]
  Content theme: [...]
  CTA:        [...]
  Branch after: [...]

  ...continue for all emails in the sequence
```

**Timing guidelines by sequence type:**

| Type | Email 1 | Subsequent Emails | Final Email |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Onboarding | Immediate | 1–3 days apart (faster early, slower later) | Day 14–30 depending on activation timeline |
| Nurture | Immediate or next day | 3–7 days apart | After full value delivery, before going stale |
| Re-engagement | Day 1 of inactivity threshold | 3–5 days apart | 14–21 days — final sunset notice |
| Event-triggered | Within 1 hour of trigger | 1–3 days apart | Within 7 days of trigger |

### Step 3: Draft Individual Emails

For each email in the sequence map, produce a draft. Each email must stand on its own (recipients may not read every email) while contributing to the sequence arc.

**Email draft structure:**

```
EMAIL [N]: [Name]
  Subject line:   [Primary option]
  Subject line B: [A/B test variant — change ONE element]
  Preview text:   [The text that appears after the subject in inbox view]

  ---

  [Salutation]

  [Opening — 1-2 sentences connecting to the recipient's context or the sequence trigger.
   Answer: why am I receiving this? why should I care?]

  [Body — 2-4 short paragraphs delivering on the email's content theme.
   One idea per paragraph. Short sentences. Scannable.]

  [CTA — clear, specific, single primary action.
   Button text: [action-oriented verb phrase]
   Link: [destination]]

  [Closing — 1-2 sentences. Set expectation for next email if appropriate.]

  [Signature]

  ---

  Notes for implementation:
  - Personalisation tokens: [list any merge fields used — e.g., {{first_name}}, {{company}}, {{product_feature}}]
  - Dynamic content: [any sections that vary by segment or behaviour]
  - Legal requirements: [unsubscribe link, physical address, any industry-specific disclosures]
```

**Email drafting principles:**

| Principle | Application |
| --- | --- |
| One email, one goal | Each email has a single primary CTA. Secondary links are acceptable but should not compete. |
| Progressive value | Each email in the sequence delivers value independent of whether prior emails were read. |
| Respect attention | Keep emails scannable. Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and clear visual hierarchy. |
| Earned escalation | Do not ask for high-commitment actions (purchase, demo, meeting) until value has been established. |
| Context awareness | Reference the trigger event or recipient's stage. Generic-feeling automated emails get ignored. |

### Step 4: Design Branching Logic

Define the decision points where the sequence adapts based on recipient behaviour.

**Standard branching patterns:**

| Trigger | Branch Action |
| --- | --- |
| Recipient completes the sequence goal | Exit sequence → move to next lifecycle stage |
| Recipient clicks CTA but does not convert | Branch to a follow-up email addressing common objections |
| Recipient opens but does not click | Resend with different subject line or CTA after 2–3 days |
| Recipient does not open 2+ consecutive emails | Reduce frequency or move to re-engagement sequence |
| Recipient unsubscribes | Exit immediately — legal requirement |
| Recipient enrolls in a higher-priority sequence | Pause or exit this sequence to prevent overlap |

**Branching documentation format:**

```
DECISION POINT: After Email [N]
  IF [condition — e.g., "clicked CTA and completed activation step"]
    THEN → [action — e.g., "Exit sequence, enroll in nurture sequence"]
  ELSE IF [condition — e.g., "opened but did not click"]
    THEN → [action — e.g., "Send Email N+1 (alternative CTA) after 2 days"]
  ELSE [default — e.g., "no open"]
    THEN → [action — e.g., "Send Email N+1 after 3 days"]
```

### Step 5: Set Performance Benchmarks

Define how sequence health will be monitored. All benchmarks must come from YOUR historical data or be established during a baseline period.

**Sequence health metrics:**

| Metric | What It Measures | Monitor At |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sequence completion rate | % of enrolled recipients reaching the desired state | Sequence level |
| Per-email open rate | Engagement with individual emails | Email level |
| Per-email click rate | Action taken on individual emails | Email level |
| Drop-off rate | % who disengage at each step | Per-email transition |
| Time to goal | How long it takes completers to reach the desired state | Sequence level |
| Unsubscribe rate | Recipient opt-outs per email | Email level |

**Benchmark-setting process:**

1. If historical sequence data exists, use your own past performance as the baseline
2. If no historical data, run the sequence for 2–4 weeks as a baseline period before optimising
3. Set improvement targets as percentage gains over YOUR baseline — not against external benchmarks
4. Monitor weekly during the first month, then bi-weekly once the sequence is stable

**Diagnostic triggers:**

| Signal | Likely Cause | Investigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low open rate on Email 1 | Subject line, sender name, or timing | A/B test subject lines; check send time |
| High opens but low clicks | Content-CTA mismatch or weak CTA | Review CTA clarity and relevance |
| Sharp drop-off after specific email | That email is not delivering value or is asking too much | Review content, timing, and ask level |
| High unsubscribes on a specific email | Perceived irrelevance or excessive frequency | Review targeting, personalisation, and timing |
| Overall low completion rate | Sequence goal too ambitious, wrong audience, or too many emails | Reassess goal, entry criteria, and sequence length |

## Anti-Patterns

Patterns that consistently undermine email sequence effectiveness:

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Too many emails, too fast** | Recipient fatigue → unsubscribes and spam complaints | Space emails appropriately; fewer high-quality emails outperform many mediocre ones |
| **No clear exit condition** | Recipients loop or receive irrelevant emails after converting | Define exit conditions for every sequence |
| **Missing unsubscribe** | Legal non-compliance (GDPR, CAN-SPAM, CASL) | Every email must include a functioning unsubscribe mechanism — non-negotiable |
| **Generic "batch and blast" disguised as automation** | No personalisation or context awareness → low engagement | Use personalisation tokens, behavioural triggers, and segment-specific content |
| **CTA overload** | Multiple competing calls to action → decision paralysis | One primary CTA per email; secondary links de-emphasised |
| **All ask, no value** | Every email pushes for conversion → recipients disengage | Alternate between value-delivery and conversion-ask emails (aim for 3:1 ratio) |
| **No suppression rules** | Recipients in multiple sequences get overwhelmed | Implement frequency caps and sequence priority rules |
| **Ignoring time zones** | Emails arrive at inconvenient times → lower open rates | Send in recipient's local time zone when possible |

## Guardrails

- Never generate email performance benchmarks (open rates, click rates, conversion rates). All data must come from the user's email platform.
- Never claim "best" send times, "optimal" frequency, or "ideal" sequence length. These depend on the audience and must be tested.
- Without brand guidelines, use neutral professional tone and label copy as `[Draft — adapt to your brand voice]`.
- Flag outputs: `[From customer data]` for sourced data · `[Framework methodology]` for this skill's approach · `[Draft — adapt to your brand voice]` for copy requiring adaptation.
